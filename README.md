Lenovo Leap Assignment 1: Introduction to Frontend Development

In this assignment, I learned the fundamentals of front-end web development with a focus on HTML and CSS. I gained a clear understanding of how websites work, how to structure content using HTML tags and elements, and how to apply attributes, IDs, and class selectors. I also explored core CSS concepts, including styling text, managing color and spacing, and understanding the Box Model. The course introduced layout techniques, helping me grasp how elements are visually arranged on a webpage. By the end of the assignment, I successfully built and styled a basic webpage by applying foundational HTML and CSS principles.
